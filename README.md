# Calculator
Java Calculator created by me.

I am stil new to creating projects and I have done the basics of a sourceCode. I am going to add the presedence of the sourceCode in the future. 
I have uploaded the sourceCode's .jar file in case you all needed, you can run it inside your command prompt to try to use it.
There will still be some bugs available so don't mind it, I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
